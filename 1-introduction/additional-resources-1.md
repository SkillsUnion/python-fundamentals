## Introduction

We'll be using Colab for this course. However, if you're interested in setting up Python on your local machine, here are some resources to help you get started.

## Installation

If you just need regular Python, you can follow this [Python Installation Guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/).

If you're looking for a more comprehensive package including data science and machine learning libraries, you should follow the [Anaconda Installation Guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).

Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. You can think of it as a local version of Google Colab. If you're interested in using Jupyter Notebook, you can follow the [Jupyter Notebook Installation Guide](https://jupyter.org/install).

## Jupyter Notebook

To get started with Jupyter Notebook, you can follow this [Jupyter Notebook Tutorial](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/). It will walk you through the basics of Jupyter Notebook and show you how to create your first notebook.
