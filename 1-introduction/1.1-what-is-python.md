## History

Python was created by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, in the late 1980s. The language was named after the British comedy group Monty Python, not the snake. Python was designed to be easy to read and write, with a clean and simple syntax.

The first version of Python, Python 0.9.0, was released in 1991. Since then, Python has evolved into a powerful and popular programming language.
