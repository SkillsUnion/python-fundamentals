# 1.3 Google Colab

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Explain what Google Colab is
- Identify the key features of Google Colab
- Create and run a Python notebook in Google Colab
- Save and share your work in Google Colab

## Introduction

Google Colab is a free cloud-based service that allows you to write and execute Python code in a web browser. It is built on top of Jupyter Notebook, an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

Google Colab is a popular choice among data scientists, machine learning engineers, and researchers because it provides free access to powerful computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs. It also integrates seamlessly with other Google services, such as Google Drive and Google Sheets.

## Getting Started

To get started with Google Colab, you will need a Google account. If you don't have one, you can create one for free at [https://accounts.google.com/signup](https://accounts.google.com/signup).

Once you have a Google account, you can access Google Colab by going to [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com). You can create a new Python notebook by clicking on the "New Notebook" button.

## Key Features

Google Colab has several key features that make it a powerful tool for writing and running Python code:

- **Free Access to GPUs and TPUs**: Google Colab provides free access to GPUs and TPUs, which can significantly speed up the training of machine learning models.
- **Collaboration**: Google Colab allows you to share your notebooks with others and collaborate in real-time.
- **Integration with Google Services**: Google Colab integrates seamlessly with other Google services, such as Google Drive and Google Sheets.
- **Rich Text Formatting**: Google Colab supports rich text formatting, including headings, lists, and hyperlinks.
- **Interactive Widgets**: Google Colab supports interactive widgets that allow you to create interactive visualizations and user interfaces.
- **Code Snippets**: Google Colab provides code snippets that allow you to quickly insert common code patterns into your notebooks.

## Basic Usage

To create a new Python notebook in Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. Go to [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com).
2. Click on the "New Notebook" button.
3. Write your Python code in the code cells.
4. Click on the "Play" button to run the code in a cell.
5. Saving is automatic, but you can also save manually by clicking on "File" -> "Save".
6. Share your work by clicking on "Share" and entering the email addresses of the people you want to share it with.

To copy an existing notebook to your Google Drive, follow these steps:

1. Go to the link of the notebook you want to copy.
2. Click on "File" -> "Save a copy in Drive".
3. A new tab will open with the copied notebook in your Google Drive.
4. You can now edit and run the notebook as you would with a new notebook.
