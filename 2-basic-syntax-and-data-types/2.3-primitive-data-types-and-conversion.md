# 2.3 Primitive Data Types and Conversion

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Define primitive data types in Python
- Convert between data types
- Use type conversion functions
- Use type coercion

## Primitive Data Types

In Python, data types are divided into two categories: primitive and non-primitive. Primitive data types are the basic data types that are built into the language. The most common primitive data types in Python are:

- **Integers (int):** Whole numbers, e.g., `5`, `-3`, `1000`.
- **Floating-point numbers (float):** Numbers with a decimal point, e.g., `3.14`, `-0.5`, `2.0`.
- **Strings (str):** Sequences of characters enclosed in single or double quotes, e.g., `"Hello, World!"`, `'Python'`.
- **Booleans (bool):** Logical values representing `True` or `False`.
- **NoneType (None):** A special data type representing the absence of a value.

You can use the `type()` function to determine the data type of a variable. For example:

```python
x = 5
y = 3.14
z = "Hello, World!"
a = True
b = None

print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>
print(type(y))  # <class 'float'>
print(type(z))  # <class 'str'>
print(type(a))  # <class 'bool'>
print(type(b))  # <class 'NoneType'>
```

## Type Conversion

Sometimes you may need to convert data from one type to another. Python provides built-in functions for type conversion. The most common type conversion functions are:

- `int()`: Converts a value to an integer.
- `float()`: Converts a value to a floating-point number.
- `str()`: Converts a value to a string.
- `bool()`: Converts a value to a boolean.

For example:

```python
x = 5
y = "10"

# Convert y to an integer
y = int(y)

print(x + y)  # 15
```

## Type Coercion

Type coercion is the automatic conversion of data types by the Python interpreter. Python will automatically convert data types when performing operations that involve different types. For example:

```python
x = 5
y = 3.14

print(x + y)  # 8.14
```

In this example, Python automatically converts the integer `5` to a floating-point number `5.0` before performing the addition operation.

Type coercion can be useful, but it can also lead to unexpected results if you are not careful. It is important to be aware of how Python handles type coercion to avoid potential issues in your code.
