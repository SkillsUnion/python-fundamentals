# 6.2 Methods

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Define methods in Python classes.
- The `__str__` method in Python.
- Understand the concept of instance methods, class methods, and static methods in Python.
- Use instance methods, class methods, and static methods in Python classes.

## Introduction

In the previous lesson, we learned about classes and objects in Python. In this lesson, we will learn about methods in Python classes.

A method is a function that is defined inside a class. Methods are used to define the behaviors of the objects created from the class. There are three types of methods in Python classes:

- Instance methods
- Class methods
- Static methods

### Instance Methods

Instance methods are methods that are defined inside a class and are called on an instance of the class. Instance methods take `self` as the first parameter, which is a reference to the current instance of the class. Instance methods can access and modify the instance variables of the class. To define an instance method, you use the `def` keyword followed by the method name and the `self` parameter. For example:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")

    def celebrate_birthday(self):
        self.age += 1
        print(f"Happy birthday, {self.name}! You are now {self.age} years old.")

    def change_name(self, new_name):
        self.name = new_name

person = Person("Alice", 30)
person.greet()  # Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
person.celebrate_birthday()  # Happy birthday, Alice! You are now 31 years old.
person.change_name("Bob")
person.greet()  # Hello, my name is Bob and I am 31 years old.
```

### The `__str__` Method

The `__str__` method is a special instance method that is used to return a string representation of an object. The `__str__` method is called when you use the `str()` function or the `print()` function on an object. To define the `__str__` method, you use the `def` keyword followed by the method name `__str__` and the `self` parameter. The `__str__` method should return a string representation of the object. For example:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Person(name={self.name}, age={self.age})"

person = Person("Alice", 30)
print(person)  # Person(name=Alice, age=30)
```

## Class Variables and Methods

Class variables are variables that are defined inside a class but outside any method. Class variables are shared among all instances of the class. Class variables are accessed using the class name or the instance name.

Class methods are methods that are defined inside a class and are called on the class itself rather than an instance of the class. Class methods take `cls` as the first parameter, which is a reference to the class itself. Class methods can access and modify class variables. To define a class method, you use the `@classmethod` decorator followed by the `def` keyword, the method name, and the `cls` parameter.

```python
class Person:
    count = 0

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        Person.count += 1

    @classmethod
    def get_count(cls):
        return cls.count

    @classmethod
    def create_person(cls, name, age):
        return cls(name, age)

print(Person.get_count())  # 0
person1 = Person.create_person("Alice", 30)
print(Person.get_count())  # 1
person2 = Person.create_person("Bob", 25)
print(Person.get_count())  # 2
```

In the example above, we defined a class method `get_count` that returns the value of the `count` class variable and a class method `create_person` that creates a new `Person` object. The `create_person` method is used to create new `Person` objects without directly calling the constructor.

## Static Methods

Static methods are methods that are defined inside a class but do not take `self` or `cls` as the first parameter. Static methods are used when the method does not depend on the instance or class and does not access or modify instance or class variables. To define a static method, you use the `@staticmethod` decorator followed by the `def` keyword and the method name. For example:

```python
class Math:
    @staticmethod
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

    @staticmethod
    def subtract(a, b):
        return a - b

print(Math.add(3, 5))  # 8
print(Math.subtract(5, 3))  # 2
```

## Exercise

1. Define a class called `Circle` with a class variable `PI` set to `3.14159`, an instance variable `radius`, and the following methods:

   - `__init__(self, radius)`: Initializes the `radius` instance variable.
   - `get_area(self)`: Returns the area of the circle (area = π \* radius^2).
   - `get_circumference(self)`: Returns the circumference of the circle (circumference = 2 _ π _ radius).
   - `set_radius(self, radius)`: Sets the `radius` instance variable to the given value.

Ans:

```python
class Circle:
    PI = 3.14159

    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def get_area(self):
        return Circle.PI * self.radius ** 2

    def get_circumference(self):
        return 2 * Circle.PI * self.radius

    def set_radius(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius
```

2. Create an object from the `Circle` class with a radius of `5` and print the area and circumference of the circle.

Ans:

```python
circle = Circle(5)
print(circle.get_area())
print(circle.get_circumference())
```

3. Change the radius of the circle to `10` and print the area and circumference of the circle.

Ans:

```python
circle.set_radius(10)
print(circle.get_area())
print(circle.get_circumference())
```

4. Define a static method called `get_pi()` in the `Circle` class that returns the value of `PI`.

Ans:

```python
class Circle:
    PI = 3.14159

    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def get_area(self):
        return Circle.PI * self.radius ** 2

    def get_circumference(self):
        return 2 * Circle.PI * self.radius

    def set_radius(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    @staticmethod
    def get_pi():
        return Circle.PI
```
