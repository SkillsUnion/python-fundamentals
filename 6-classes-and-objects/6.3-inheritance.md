# 6.3 Inheritance

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Define inheritance in Python classes.
- Understand the concept of base classes and derived classes.
- Use inheritance to create subclasses with shared properties and behaviors.
- Override methods in subclasses.
- Use the `super()` function to call methods of the base class.

## Introduction

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming. Inheritance allows you to create a new class that inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class. The existing class is called the base class or parent class, and the new class is called the derived class or subclass. Inheritance allows you to reuse code and create a hierarchy of classes with shared properties and behaviors.

In Python, you can define a class that inherits from another class by specifying the base class in parentheses after the class name. For example:

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        return "Animal sound!"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"

dog = Dog("Buddy")
cat = Cat("Whiskers")

print(dog.speak())  # Woof!
print(cat.speak())  # Meow!
```

## Base Classes and Derived Classes

Inheritance allows you to create a hierarchy of classes with shared properties and behaviors. For example, you can have a base class `Shape` with properties like `color` and methods like `area`, and derived classes like `Circle` and `Rectangle` that inherit from the `Shape` class and provide specific implementations for the `area` method.

```python
class Shape:
    def __init__(self, color):
        self.color = color

    def area(self):
        return 0

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, color, radius):
        super().__init__(color)
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, color, width, height):
        super().__init__(color)
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

circle = Circle("Red", 5)
rectangle = Rectangle("Blue", 3, 4)

print(circle.area())  # 78.5
print(circle.color)  # Red
print(rectangle.area())  # 12
print(rectangle.color)  # Blue
```

In the example above, we defined a base class `Shape` with a property `color` and a method `area`. We then defined two derived classes `Circle` and `Rectangle` that inherit from the `Shape` class and provide specific implementations for the `area` method. The `super()` function is used to call the constructor of the base class in the derived class.

## Exercise

1. Define a base class `Vehicle` with properties `make`, `model`, and `year`, and a method `display_info` that prints the make, model, and year of the vehicle.

Ans:

```python
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year

    def display_info(self):
        print(f"Make: {self.make}, Model: {self.model}, Year: {self.year}")
```

1. Create a derived classes `Car` that inherits from the `Vehicle` class. Override the `__ini__` method to include `doors` (number of doors) as a parameter and the `display_info` method to print the number of doors in the `display_info` method.

Ans:

```python
class Car(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, make, model, year, doors):
        super().__init__(make, model, year)
        self.doors = doors

    def display_info(self):
        super().display_info()
        print(f"Doors: {self.doors}")
```

2. Create a derived classes `Truck` that inherits from the `Vehicle` class. Override the `__ini__` method to include `towing_capacity` as a parameter and the `display_info` method to print the towing capacity in the `display_info` method.

Ans:

```python
class Truck(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, make, model, year, towing_capacity):
        super().__init__(make, model, year)
        self.towing_capacity = towing_capacity

    def display_info(self):
        super().display_info()
        print(f"Towing Capacity: {self.towing_capacity}")
```

3. Create an object from the `Car` class with the make `Honda`, model `Civic`, year `2020`, and number of doors `4`, and call the `display_info` method.

Ans:

```python
car = Car("Honda", "Civic", 2020, 4)
car.display_info()
```

4. Create an object from the `Truck` class with the make `Chevrolet`, model `Silverado`, year `2019`, and towing capacity `10000`, and call the `display_info` method.

Ans:

```python
truck = Truck("Chevrolet", "Silverado", 2019, 10000)
```
