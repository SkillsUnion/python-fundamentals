# 6.1 Constructors and Instantiation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Define classes in Python.
- Define constructors in Python classes.
- Instantiate objects from Python classes.

## Introduction

Classes are a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming. In object-oriented programming, classes are used to model real-world entities and define their properties and behaviors. Python is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it supports classes and objects. A class is a blueprint for creating objects, and an object is an instance of a class.

## Classes

In Python, you can define a class using the `class` keyword followed by the class name. For example:

```python
class Person:
    pass
```

In the example above, we defined a class called `Person`. The name of the class should be in CamelCase, with the first letter of each word capitalized.

The `pass` statement is used as a placeholder to indicate that the class is empty. We will learn how to define properties and methods inside a class to model the attributes and behaviors of the real-world entity that the class represents.

You can create an object from a class by calling the class name followed by a pair of parentheses. This is called instantiation.

```python
person = Person()
```

In the example above, we created an object called `person` from the `Person` class. The object `person` is an instance of the `Person` class.

## Constructors

A constructor is a special method in a class that is used to initialize the object. In Python, the constructor method is called `__init__`. The constructor method is automatically called when an object is created from a class.

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
```

In the example above, we defined a constructor method `__init__` in the `Person` class. The constructor takes two parameters `name` and `age` and initializes the properties `self.name` and `self.age` with the values passed to the constructor. Properties defined in the constructor are also called instance variables.

The `self` parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class.

You can create an object from the `Person` class and pass values to the constructor as arguments. For example:

```python
person = Person("Alice", 30)

print(person.name)  # Alice
print(person.age)  # 30
```

In the example above, we created an object called `person` from the `Person` class and passed the values `"Alice"` and `30` to the constructor. The object `person` now has two instance variables `name` and `age` with the values `"Alice"` and `30`, respectively.

You can modify the properties of an object by accessing them using the dot notation. For example:

```python
person.age = 31

print(person.age)  # 31
```

## Exercise

1. Define a class called `Book` with a constructor that initializes the properties `title`, `author`, and `year`. Create an object from the `Book` class and print the values of the properties.

Ans:

```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author, year):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.year = year

book = Book("Python Programming", "Alice", 2022)

print(book.title)  # Python Programming
print(book.author)  # Alice
print(book.year)  # 2022
```

2. What is the output of the following code snippet?

```python
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

circle = Circle(5)
print(circle.radius)
```

Ans: `5`
