# 4.2 While Loops

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Understand what loops are
- Use the `while` loop in Python
- Use the `break` and `continue` statements in a loop
- Use the `else` statement in a loop

## Introduction

Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times. In Python, the `while` loop is used to execute a block of code as long as a condition is `True`.

The syntax of the `while` loop is as follows:

```python
while condition:
    # code block
```

The code block is executed repeatedly as long as the condition is `True`. If the condition is `False`, the loop is terminated, and the program continues with the next statement after the loop.

For example:

```python
x = 0

while x < 5:
    print(x)
    x += 1
```

In this example, the loop will print the numbers `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4` because the condition `x < 5` is `True` for these values of `x`.

## Break Statement

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely. When the `break` statement is encountered, the loop is terminated, and the program continues with the next statement after the loop.

For example:

```python
x = 0

while x < 5:
    print(x)
    if x == 2:
        break
    x += 1
```

In this example, the loop will print the numbers `0`, `1`, and `2` because the `break` statement is encountered when `x == 2`.

## Continue Statement

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code block and continue with the next iteration of the loop. When the `continue` statement is encountered, the program jumps back to the beginning of the loop and evaluates the condition again.

For example:

```python
x = 0

while x < 5:
    x += 1
    if x == 2:
        continue
    print(x)
```

In this example, the loop will print the numbers `1`, `3`, `4`, and `5` because the `continue` statement is encountered when `x == 2`.

## Else Statement

The `else` statement can be used in a loop to execute a block of code when the loop condition is `False`. The syntax of the `else` statement in a loop is as follows:

```python
while condition:
    # code block
else:
    # code block
```

The `else` statement is only executed when the loop condition is `False`. If the loop is terminated prematurely using the `break` statement, the `else` statement is not executed.

For example:

```python
x = 0

while x < 5:
    print(x)
    x += 1
else:
    print("Loop finished")
```

In this example, the loop will print the numbers `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`, and then print "Loop finished" because the loop condition `x < 5` is `False` when `x == 5`.

## Exercise

1. What is the output of the following code?

```python
x = 10

while x > 0:
    print(x)
    x -= 1
```

Ans: `10`, `9`, `8`, `7`, `6`, `5`, `4`, `3`, `2`, `1`

2. What is the output of the following code?

```python
x = 0

while x < 5:
    print(x)
    x += 1
else:
    print("Loop finished")
```

Ans: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `Loop finished`

3. What is the output of the following code?

```python
x = 0

while x < 5:
    x += 1
    if x == 2:
        continue
    print(x)
    if x == 4:
        break
```

Ans: `1`, `3`, `4`
