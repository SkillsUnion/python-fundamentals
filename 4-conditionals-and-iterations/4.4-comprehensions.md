# 4.4 Comprehensions

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Use list comprehensions in Python
- Use dictionary comprehensions in Python
- Use generator comprehensions in Python

## Introduction

Comprehensions are a concise way to create sequences, such as lists, dictionaries, sets, and generators, in Python. They allow you to create a new sequence by transforming or filtering an existing sequence. Comprehensions are more readable and expressive than traditional loops and can help you write more efficient and maintainable code.

## List Comprehensions

List comprehensions are used to create lists in Python. The syntax of a list comprehension is as follows:

```python
new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]
```

The list comprehension iterates over each item in the iterable and applies the expression to create a new list. The condition is optional and can be used to filter the items in the iterable.

For example:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

squares = [x ** 2 for x in numbers]

print(squares)  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

In this example, the list comprehension `x ** 2` is applied to each element in the `numbers` list to create a new list of squares.

## Dictionary Comprehensions

Dictionary comprehensions are used to create dictionaries in Python. The syntax of a dictionary comprehension is as follows:

```python
new_dict = {key: value for item in iterable if condition}
```

The dictionary comprehension iterates over each item in the iterable and applies the expression to create a new dictionary. The condition is optional and can be used to filter the items in the iterable.

For example:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

fruit_lengths = {fruit: len(fruit) for fruit in fruits}

print(fruit_lengths)  # {'apple': 5, 'banana': 6, 'cherry': 6}
```

In this example, the dictionary comprehension `len(fruit)` is applied to each element in the `fruits` list to create a new dictionary of fruit lengths.

You can also use dictionary comprehensions to create dictionaries from other dictionaries:

```python
students = {"Alice": 25, "Bob": 30, "Charlie": 35}

adult_students = {name: age for name, age in students.items() if age >= 30}

print(adult_students)  # {'Bob': 30, 'Charlie': 35}
```

## Generator Comprehensions

Generator is a type of iterable that generates values on-the-fly. Instead of storing all the values in memory, a generator produces values one at a time, which can be more memory-efficient for large sequences.

Generator comprehensions are used to create generators in Python. The syntax of a generator comprehension is similar to a list comprehension, but it uses parentheses instead of square brackets:

```python
new_generator = (expression for item in iterable if condition)
```

The generator comprehension iterates over each item in the iterable and applies the expression to create a new generator. The condition is optional and can be used to filter the items in the iterable.

For example:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

squares_generator = (x ** 2 for x in numbers)

print(squares_generator)  # <generator object <genexpr> at 0x7f8b1c7b3d60>
print(list(squares_generator))  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

In this example, the generator comprehension `x ** 2` is applied to each element in the `numbers` list to create a new generator of squares.

## Exercise

1. What is the output of the following list comprehension?

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

doubled_numbers = [x * 2 for x in numbers]

print(doubled_numbers)
```

Ans: `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`

2. What is the output of the following dictionary comprehension?

```python
grades = {"Alice": 90, "Bob": 85, "Charlie": 95}

passing_grades = {name: grade for name, grade in grades.items() if grade >= 90}

print(passing_grades)
```

Ans: `{'Alice': 90, 'Charlie': 95}`
