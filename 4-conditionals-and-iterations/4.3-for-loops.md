## Introduction

Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times. In Python, the `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence of elements, such as a range of numbers, a string, a list, or a dictionary.

The syntax of the `for` loop is as follows:

```python
for element in sequence:
    # code block
```

The `for` loop iterates over each element in the sequence and executes the code block for each element. The loop continues until all elements in the sequence have been processed.

For example:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

In this example, the loop will print each element in the `fruits` list.

## Range Function

The `range()` function is commonly used in `for` loops to generate a sequence of numbers. The `range()` function takes up to three arguments: `start`, `stop`, and `step`. The `start` argument specifies the starting value of the sequence, the `stop` argument specifies the end value of the sequence (not inclusive), and the `step` argument specifies the increment between each value in the sequence.

For example:

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

In this example, the loop will print the numbers `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`.

You can also specify the `start`, `stop`, and `step` arguments in the `range()` function:

```python
for i in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(i)
```

In this example, the loop will print the numbers `1`, `3`, `5`, `7`, and `9`.

## Break Statement

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely. When the `break` statement is encountered, the loop is terminated, and the program continues with the next statement after the loop.

For example:

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
    if i == 2:
        break
```

In this example, the loop will print the numbers `0`, `1`, and `2` because the `break` statement is encountered when `i == 2`.

## Continue Statement

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code block and continue with the next iteration of the loop. When the `continue` statement is encountered, the program jumps back to the beginning of the loop and evaluates the condition again.

For example:

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)
```

In this example, the loop will print the numbers `0`, `1`, `3`, and `4` because the `continue` statement is encountered when `i == 2`.

## Else Statement

The `else` statement can be used in a loop to execute a block of code when the loop completes normally (i.e., without encountering a `break` statement). The syntax of the `else` statement in a loop is as follows:

```python
for element in sequence:
    # code block
else:
    # code block
```

The `else` statement is only executed if the loop completes normally without encountering a `break` statement.

For example:

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop completed normally")
```

In this example, the loop will print the numbers `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`, and then print `Loop completed normally`.

## Nested For Loops

You can nest `for` loops inside each other to iterate over multiple sequences. The inner loop is executed for each iteration of the outer loop.

For example:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
colors = ["red", "yellow", "purple"]

for fruit in fruits:
    for color in colors:
        print(fruit, color)
```

In this example, the inner loop will iterate over each element in the `colors` list for each element in the `fruits` list.

## Looping Through Strings and Dictionaries

You can also use the `for` loop to iterate over strings and dictionaries.

### Strings

You can iterate over each character in a string using a `for` loop:

```python
for char in "hello":
    print(char)
```

In this example, the loop will print each character in the string `"hello"`.

### Dictionaries

You can iterate over each key in a dictionary using a `for` loop:

```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}

for key in person:
    print(key, person[key])
```

In this example, the loop will print each key-value pair in the `person` dictionary.

You can also iterate over each key-value pair in a dictionary using the `items()` method. This also makes use of tuple unpacking:

```python
for key, value in person.items():
    print(key, value)
```

In this example, the loop will print each key-value pair in the `person` dictionary.

## Enumerate Function

The `enumerate()` function can be used in a `for` loop to get both the index and value of each element in a sequence. The `enumerate()` function returns a tuple containing the index and value of each element.

For example:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(index, fruit)
```

In this example, the loop will print the index and value of each element in the `fruits` list.

## Zip Function

The `zip()` function can be used in a `for` loop to iterate over multiple sequences simultaneously. The `zip()` function combines the elements of multiple sequences into tuples and returns an iterator of tuples.

For example:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
colors = ["red", "yellow", "purple"]

for fruit, color in zip(fruits, colors):
    print(fruit, color)
```

In this example, the loop will print each element in the `fruits` list paired with the corresponding element in the `colors` list.

## Exercise Qestions

1. Write a Python program to print the numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.
   Ans:

   ```python
   for i in range(1, 11):
       print(i)
   ```

2. Write a Python program to print the even numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.
   Ans:

   ```python
   for i in range(2, 11, 2):
           print(i)
   ```

3. What is the output of the following code?

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for i in range(len(fruits)):
    print(fruits[i])
```

Ans: `apple`, `banana`, `cherry`
