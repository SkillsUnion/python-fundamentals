# 4.1 If, Elif and Else

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Understand what conditional statements are
- Use the `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements in Python
- Use the shorthand `if` and `if else` statement

## Introduction

Conditional statements are used to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. In Python, the `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements are used to create conditional statements.

## If Statement

The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a condition is `True`. The syntax of the `if` statement is as follows:

```python
if condition:
    # code block
```

The code block is executed only if the condition is `True`. If the condition is `False`, the code block is skipped.

For example:

```python
x = 5

if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
```

In this example, the code block `print("x is positive")` is executed because the condition `x > 0` is `True`.

## Elif Statement

The `elif` statement is used to check multiple conditions after the `if` statement. The syntax of the `elif` statement is as follows:

```python
if condition1:
    # code block
elif condition2:
    # code block
```

The `elif` statement is only executed if the previous conditions are `False` and the current condition is `True`.

For example:

```python
x = 0

if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
elif x < 0:
    print("x is negative")
elif x == 0:
    print("x is zero")
```

In this example, the code block `print("x is zero")` is executed because the previous conditions `x > 0` and `x < 0` are `False`, and the current condition `x == 0` is `True`.

## Else Statement

The `else` statement is used to execute a block of code if all the previous conditions are `False`. The syntax of the `else` statement is as follows:

```python
if condition:
    # code block
else:
    # code block
```

The `else` statement is only executed if all the previous conditions are `False`.

For example:

```python
x = -5

if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
else:
    print("x is not positive")
```

In this example, the code block `print("x is not positive")` is executed because the condition `x > 0` is `False`.

In the elif example before, we can also replace the last elif statement with an else statement:

```python
x = 0

if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
elif x < 0:
    print("x is negative")
else:
    print("x is zero")
```

In this example, the code block `print("x is zero")` is executed because the previous conditions `x > 0` and `x < 0` are `False`, and the `else` statement is executed.

## Shorthand If

You can also write a shorthand `if` statement, which is a one-liner version of the `if` statement. The syntax of the shorthand `if` statement is as follows:

```python
if condition: # code block
```

For example:

```python
x = 5

if x > 0: print("x is positive")
```

## Shorthand If Else

You can also write a shorthand `if else` statement, which is a one-liner version of the `if else` statement. The syntax of the shorthand `if else` statement is as follows:

```python
value_if_true if condition else value_if_false
```

For example:

```python
x = 5

print("x is positive") if x > 0 else print("x is not positive")
```

In this example, the code block `print("x is positive")` is executed if the condition `x > 0` is `True`, otherwise the code block `print("x is not positive")` is executed.

## Exercise

1. What is the output of the following code?

```python
x = 12

if x % 2 == 0:
    print("x is even")
else:
    print("x is odd")
```

Ans: `x is even`

2. What is the output of the following code?

```python
savings_account = 1000

if savings_account > 800:
    print("You have more than $800 in your savings account")
elif savings_account > 500:
    print("You have more than $500 in your savings account")
else:
    print("You have less than $500 in your savings account")
```

Ans: `You have more than $800 in your savings account`

3. What is the output of the following shorthand `if else` statement?

```python
x = 3

print("x is even") if x % 2 == 0 else print("x is odd")
```

Ans: `x is odd`
