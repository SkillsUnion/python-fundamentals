# 7.2 Error Handling

## Learning Objectives

- Handle exceptions using `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks.
- Use the `else` block to execute code when no exceptions are raised.

## Introduction

When an exception occurs, the program stops executing, and an error message is displayed. To handle exceptions and prevent the program from crashing, you can use error handling techniques.

## The `try` and `except` Blocks

To handle exceptions in Python, you can use the `try` and `except` blocks. The `try` block is used to enclose the code that might raise an exception. The `except` block is used to catch and handle exceptions that occur in the `try` block.

```python
try:
    x = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Division by zero!")
```

In the example above, the `try` block contains the code that might raise an exception (division by zero). The `except` block catches the `ZeroDivisionError` exception and prints a message.

You can catch multiple exceptions by specifying them in a tuple after the `except` keyword.

```python
try:
    x = 10 / 0
except (ZeroDivisionError, ValueError):
    print("An error occurred!")
```

You can also catch different exceptions separately by using multiple `except` blocks.

```python
try:
    x = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Division by zero!")
except ValueError:
    print("Value error!")
```

You can catch all exceptions by using the `except` block without specifying an exception type. This is useful for handling unexpected exceptions.

```python
try:
    x = 10 / 0
except:
    print("An error occurred!")
```

## The `finally` Block

The `finally` block is used to execute code that should always run, regardless of whether an exception is raised or not. The `finally` block is useful for releasing resources like files, database connections, or network connections.

For example, you can use the `finally` block to close a file that was opened in the `try` block.

```python
try:
    file = open("example.txt", "r")
    print(file.read())
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found!")
finally:
    file.close()
```

In the example above, the `finally` block closes the file `example.txt` after reading its contents.

## The `else` Block

The `else` block is used to execute code when no exceptions are raised in the `try` block. The `else` block is useful for executing code that should run only if no exceptions occur.

```python
try:
    x = 10 / 2
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Division by zero!")
else:
    print("No exceptions occurred!")
```

In the example above, the `else` block prints a message when no exceptions are raised in the `try` block.

## Exercise

1. What is the output of the following code snippet?

   ```python
   try:
       numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
       print(numbers["five"])
   except TypeError:
       print("Type error!")
   except IndexError:
       print("Index error!")
   ```

   - A) Type error!
   - B) Index error!
   - C) 5
   - D) 0
     Ans: A) Type error!

1. What is the output of the following code snippet?

   ```python
    try:
         x = 10 / 0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Division by zero!")
    else:
        print("Else block!")
    finally:
        print("Finally block!")
   ```

   - A) Division by zero! Else block! Finally block!
   - B) Else block! Finally block!
   - C) Division by zero! Finally block!
   - D) Division by zero!
     Ans: C) Division by zero! Finally block!
