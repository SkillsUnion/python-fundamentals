# 7.1 Exceptions

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Understand what exceptions are in Python.
- Distinguish different types of exceptions.

## Introduction

In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception occurs, the program stops executing and raises an exception. Exceptions are used to handle errors and unexpected situations in a program.

Exceptions can be raised by the Python interpreter or by the programmer. When an exception is raised, the program stops executing and an error message is displayed.

## Types of Exceptions

There are two main types of exceptions in Python:

1. **Built-in Exceptions**: These exceptions are raised by the Python interpreter when an error occurs during the execution of a program. Some common built-in exceptions include:

   | Exception           | Description                                                                                 |
   | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `ZeroDivisionError` | Raised when division or modulo by zero occurs.                                              |
   | `TypeError`         | Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.         |
   | `ValueError`        | Raised when a function receives an argument of the correct type but an inappropriate value. |
   | `IndexError`        | Raised when an index is out of range.                                                       |
   | `KeyError`          | Raised when a dictionary key is not found.                                                  |
   | `FileNotFoundError` | Raised when a file or directory is requested but cannot be found.                           |
   | `ImportError`       | Raised when an import statement fails.                                                      |
   | `NameError`         | Raised when a local or global name is not found.                                            |
   | `SyntaxError`       | Raised when there is a syntax error in the code.                                            |
   | `IndentationError`  | Raised when there is an incorrect indentation in the code.                                  |
   | `AttributeError`    | Raised when an attribute reference or assignment fails.                                     |
   | `RuntimeError`      | Raised when an error is detected that doesn't fall into any of the other categories.        |
   | `AttributeError`    | Raised when an attribute reference or assignment fails.                                     |
   | `RuntimeError`      | Raised when an error is detected that doesn't fall into any of the other categories.        |

2. **User-Defined Exceptions**: These exceptions are raised by the programmer to handle specific errors or unexpected situations in a program. User-defined exceptions are created by defining a new class that inherits from the `Exception` class. For example:

   ```python
    class MyError(Exception):
         pass
   ```

   We defined a new exception class `MyError` that inherits from the `Exception` class. You can raise this exception by using the `raise` statement.

   ```python
   raise MyError("An error occurred")
   ```

   In the example above, we raised the `MyError` exception with the error message "An error occurred".
