# 5.1 Built-in Functions

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of functions in Python.
- Apply some of the commonly used built-in functions in Python.

## Introduction

In Python, a function is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions are used to break down large programs into smaller, more manageable pieces. They can also be reused in different parts of the program.

Built-in functions are functions that are already defined in Python. So far, we have used some built-in functions like `print()`, `len()`, `type()`, `sorted()`, `range()`, `enumerate()`, `zip()`, etc. In this lesson, we will explore some of the commonly used built-in functions in Python.

## Built-in Functions

Python has a wide range of built-in functions that can be used to perform various operations. Here are some of the commonly used built-in functions in Python:

- `abs()`: Returns the absolute value of a number.
- `max()`: Returns the largest item in an iterable.
- `min()`: Returns the smallest item in an iterable.
- `sum()`: Returns the sum of all items in an iterable.
- `round()`: Rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places.
- `all()`: Returns `True` if all items in an iterable are `True`.
- `any()`: Returns `True` if any item in an iterable is `True`.

For example, let's use some of these functions:

```python
# abs()
print(abs(-10))  # 10

# max()
print(max([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # 5

# min()
print(min([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # 1

# sum()
print(sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # 15

# round()
print(round(3.14159, 2))  # 3.14

# all()
print(all([True, True, True]))  # True
print(all([True, False, True]))  # False

# any()
print(any([True, False, False]))  # True
print(any([False, False, False]))  # False
```

## Exercise

1. What is the output of the following code snippet?

```python
numbers = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]

print(sum(numbers))
```

2. What is the output of the following code snippet?

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print(max(numbers) - min(numbers))
```

3. What is the output of the following code snippet?

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print(all([x > 0 for x in numbers]))
```
