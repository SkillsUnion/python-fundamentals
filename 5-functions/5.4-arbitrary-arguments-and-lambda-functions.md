# 5.4 Arbitrary Arguments and Lambda Functions

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Define functions with arbitrary arguments in Python.
- Define functions with keyword arguments in Python.
- Define lambda functions in Python.
- Use lambda functions with built-in functions like `map()` and `filter()`.

## Introduction

In the previous lesson, we learned how to define functions in Python. In this lesson, we will learn about arbitrary arguments, keyword arguments, and lambda functions.

## Arbitrary Arguments

In Python, you can define functions that take an arbitrary number of arguments. These are called arbitrary arguments. To define a function with arbitrary arguments, you use an asterisk (`*`) before the parameter name. For example:

```python
def greet(*names):
    for name in names:
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie")
```

In the example above, the `greet` function takes an arbitrary number of arguments and prints a greeting for each name passed to the function.

You can also pass a list or tuple of values to a function with arbitrary arguments by using the unpacking operator (`*`). For example:

```python
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]

greet(*names)
```

This will output:

```
Hello, Alice!
Hello, Bob!
Hello, Charlie!
```

## Keyword Arguments

In Python, you can also define functions that take keyword arguments. Keyword arguments are arguments that are passed to a function with a keyword and a value. To define a function with keyword arguments, you use two asterisks (`**`) before the parameter name. For example:

```python
def greet(**names):
    for name, greeting in names.items():
        print(f"{greeting}, {name}!")

greet(Alice="Hello", Bob="Hi", Charlie="Hey")
```

In the example above, the `greet` function takes keyword arguments and prints a custom greeting for each name passed to the function.

You can also pass a dictionary of values to a function with keyword arguments by using the unpacking operator (`**`). For example:

```python
names = {"Alice": "Hello", "Bob": "Hi", "Charlie": "Hey"}

greet(**names)
```

This will output:

```
Hello, Alice!
Hi, Bob!
Hey, Charlie!
```

## Lambda Functions

In Python, you can define small anonymous functions using the `lambda` keyword, followed by the arguments and a colon (`:`) that separates the arguments from the expression. The expression is evaluated and returned when the lambda function is called. There is no `return` statement in a lambda function because the expression is implicitly returned.

Lambda functions can take any number of arguments, but they can only have one expression.

Example with one argument:

```python
double = lambda x: x * 2

print(double(5))  # 10
```

Example with multiple arguments:

```python
add = lambda a, b: a + b

print(add(3, 5))  # 8
```

Lambda functions are often used with built-in functions like `map()` and `filter()` to apply a function to a sequence of elements or filter elements based on a condition.

For example, you can use a lambda function with `map()` to double each element in a list:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

doubled_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers))

print(doubled_numbers)  # [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

You can also use a lambda function with `filter()` to filter out even numbers from a list:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))

print(even_numbers)  # [2, 4]
```

## Exercise

1. What is the output of the following code snippet?

```python
def greet(*names):
    for name in names:
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet(*["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"])
```

2. What is the output of the following code snippet?

```python
def welcome_bootcamp(**students):
    for student, bootcamp in students.items():
        print(f"Welcome to {bootcamp}, {student}!")

welcome_bootcamp(**{"Alice": "Data Science", "Bob": "Web Development", "Charlie": "Cybersecurity"})
```

3. What is the output of the following code snippet?

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))

print(squared_numbers)
```

4. Rewrite the question above using a list comprehension instead of a lambda function.
