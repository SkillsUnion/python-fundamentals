# 5.3 Variable Scope

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of variable scope in Python.
- Differentiate between local and global variables.

## Introduction

In Python, variable scope refers to the visibility of variables within a program. Variables can have different scopes depending on where they are defined. Understanding variable scope is important because it determines where a variable can be accessed and modified.

## Local Scope

Variables that are defined inside a function have local scope. This means that they can only be accessed within the function in which they are defined. For example:

```python
def greet():
    message = "Hello, World!"
    print(message)

greet()
print(message)  # NameError: name 'message' is not defined
```

In the example above, the variable `message` is defined inside the `greet` function and has local scope. It cannot be accessed outside the function.

## Global Scope

Variables that are defined outside of any function have global scope. This means that they can be accessed and modified anywhere in the program. For example:

```python
message = "Hello, World!"

def greet():
    print(message)

greet()
print(message)
```

In the example above, the variable `message` is defined outside the `greet` function and has global scope. It can be accessed and printed inside the function as well as outside the function.

## Modifying Global Variables

You cannot modify a global variable inside a function without explicitly declaring it as a global variable. For example:

```python
count = 0

def increment():
    count += 1

increment()  # UnboundLocalError: local variable 'count' referenced before assignment
```

In the example above, the `increment` function tries to modify the global variable `count` by incrementing it, but it raises an error. To modify a global variable inside a function, you need to declare it as a global variable using the `global` keyword. For example:

```python
count = 0

def increment():
    global count
    count += 1

increment()
print(count)  # 1
```

In the example above, the `global` keyword is used to indicate that the `count` variable is global. This allows the `increment` function to modify the global variable.

## Exercise

1. What is the output of the following code snippet?

```python
count = 0

def increment():
    count = 1

increment()

print(count)
```

Ans: `0`

2. What is the output of the following code snippet?

```python
count = 0

def increment():
    global count
    count = 1

increment()

print(count)
```

Ans: `1`
