# 5.2 Functions

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Define functions in Python
- Understand the concept of function arguments

## Introduction

In the previous lesson, we learned about built-in functions in Python. In this lesson, we will learn how to define our own functions. This is also known as user-defined functions.

## Functions

In Python, you can define a function using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and a pair of parentheses. For example:

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

In the example above, we defined a function called `greet` that prints "Hello, World!" when called. To call a function, you simply write the function name followed by a pair of parentheses. For example:

```python
greet()
```

This will output:

```
Hello, World!
```

Functions can also take arguments. Arguments are values that are passed to the function when it is called. For example:

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

In the example above, we defined a function called `greet` that takes an argument `name` and prints "Hello, {name}!" when called. To call this function, you need to pass a value for the `name` argument. For example:

```python
greet("Alice")
```

This will output:

```
Hello, Alice!
```

In the examples above, we defined functions that only print messages, but don't return any values. If we assign the result of calling these functions to a variable, the variable will be `None`. For example:

```python
result = greet("Alice")

print(result)  # None
```

To return a value from a function, you can use the `return` statement. For example:

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

In the example above, we defined a function called `add` that takes two arguments `a` and `b` and returns their sum when called. To use the result of this function, you can assign it to a variable. For example:

```python
result = add(3, 5)

print(result)  # 8
```

## Multiple Return Values

You can also return multiple values from a function by separating them with commas. For example:

```python
def add_and_subtract(a, b):
    return a + b, a - b
```

In the example above, we defined a function called `add_and_subtract` that takes two arguments `a` and `b` and returns their sum and difference when called. To use the results of this function, you can assign them to multiple variables. For example:

```python
sum_result, diff_result = add_and_subtract(10, 5)

print(sum_result)  # 15
print(diff_result)  # 5
```

This is the tuple unpacking feature of Python.

## Multiple Return Statements

A function can have multiple `return` statements. The first `return` statement that is executed will exit the function. For example:

```python
def is_even(number):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

In the example above, we defined a function called `is_even` that takes a number as an argument and returns `True` if the number is even, and `False` otherwise. The function has two `return` statements. The first `return` statement will be executed if the number is even, and the second `return` statement will be executed if the number is odd.

## Default Arguments

We can have default values for function arguments. For example:

```python
def greet(name="World"):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

In the example above, we defined a function called `greet` that takes an argument `name` with a default value of `"World"`. If you call this function without passing any arguments, it will use the default value. For example:

```python
greet()  # Hello, World!
greet("Alice")  # Hello, Alice!
```

## Exercise

1. Write a function called `square` that takes a number as an argument and returns its square.

Ans:

```python
def square(number):
    return number ** 2
```

2. Write a function called `is_prime` that takes a number as an argument and returns `True` if the number is prime, and `False` otherwise.

Ans:

```python
def is_prime(number):
    if number < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(number ** 0.5) + 1):
        if number % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

3. Write a function called `is_palindrome` that takes a string as an argument and returns `True` if the string is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). Examples:

   - is_palindrome("radar") -> `True`
   - is_palindrome("hello") -> `False`

Ans:

```python
def is_palindrome(string):
    string = string.lower().replace(" ", "")
    return string == string[::-1]
```
