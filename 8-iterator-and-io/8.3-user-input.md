# 8.3 User Input

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Get user input in Python using the `input()` function.
- Convert user input to different data types.
- Handle user input errors and exceptions.

## Introduction

In Python, you can get user input using the `input()` function. The `input()` function reads a line of text from the standard input (usually the keyboard) and returns it as a string. You can use the `input()` function to prompt the user for input and store the result in a variable.

## Getting User Input

To get user input in Python, you can use the `input()` function. The `input()` function takes an optional prompt message as an argument and returns the user's input as a string. For example:

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

In this example, the `input()` function prompts the user to enter their name and stores the result in the `name` variable. The `print()` function then displays a greeting message using the user's name.

## Converting User Input

By default, the `input()` function returns the user's input as a string. If you need to convert the user's input to a different data type, you can use type casting functions like `int()`, `float()`, or `bool()`. For example:

```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
print("You are " + str(age) + " years old.")
```

The `input()` function reads the user's input as a string, which is then converted to an integer using the `int()` function. The user's age is stored in the `age` variable and displayed as part of a message.

## Handling User Input Errors

When getting user input, you should handle errors and exceptions that may occur if the user enters invalid data. For example, if the user enters a non-numeric value when you expect a number, you may encounter a `ValueError` when converting the input to an integer.

To handle user input errors, you can use `try` and `except` blocks to catch exceptions and display error messages. For example:

```python
try:
    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
    print("You are " + str(age) + " years old.")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid age. Please enter a number.")
```

The `try` block attempts to convert the user's input to an integer. If the conversion fails and a `ValueError` is raised, the `except` block catches the exception and displays an error message.

## Exercise

1. Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter their name and age. Display a greeting message that includes the user's name and age.
2. Modify the program to handle errors if the user enters an invalid age (e.g., a non-numeric value).
3. Write a Python program that calculates the area of a circle based on the user's input for the radius. Display the result with two decimal places.
4. Modify the program to handle errors if the user enters an invalid radius (e.g., a negative value or a non-numeric value).
