# 8.1 Iterator

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Understand what iterators are in Python.
- Differentiate between iterables and iterators.
- Use the `iter()` and `next()` functions to create and iterate over iterators.
- Create custom iterators using classes and the `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods.
- Use the `StopIteration` exception to signal the end of an iterator.

## Introduction

In Python, an iterator is an object that represents a stream of data. Iterators are used to iterate over sequences like lists, tuples, dictionaries, and strings. Iterators provide a way to access the elements of a sequence one by one without having to know the underlying data structure.

## Iterables and Iterators

An iterable is an object that can be iterated over. An iterable can be a _list, tuple, dictionary, string_, or any other object that supports iteration. An iterator is an object that implements the iterator protocol and provides a way to access the elements of an iterable one by one.

You can create an iterator from an iterable using the `iter()` function. The `iter()` function returns an iterator object that you can use to iterate over the elements of the iterable.

For example, you can create an iterator from a list as follows:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
iterator = iter(numbers)
```

You can then iterate over the elements of the iterator using the `next()` function:

```python
print(next(iterator))  # 1
print(next(iterator))  # 2
print(next(iterator))  # 3
print(next(iterator))  # 4
print(next(iterator))  # 5
```

When you reach the end of the iterator, the `next()` function raises a `StopIteration` exception. You can catch this exception to handle the end of the iterator.

## Custom Iterators

You can create custom iterators in Python by defining a class that implements the iterator protocol. To create a custom iterator, you need to define two methods:

- `__iter__()`: This method should return the iterator object itself.
- `__next__()`: This method should return the next element in the sequence or raise a `StopIteration` exception when there are no more elements to iterate over.

For example, you can create a custom iterator that iterates over the Fibonacci sequence as follows:

```python
class Fibonacci:
    def __init__(self, limit):
        self.limit = limit
        self.a, self.b = 0, 1

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.a > self.limit:
            raise StopIteration
        result = self.a
        self.a, self.b = self.b, self.a + self.b
        return result

fibonacci = Fibonacci(10)
for number in fibonacci:
    print(number)
```

In the example above, we defined a custom iterator `Fibonacci` that iterates over the Fibonacci sequence up to a given limit. The `__iter__()` method returns the iterator object itself, and the `__next__()` method returns the next element in the sequence or raises a `StopIteration` exception when there are no more elements to iterate over.

## Exercise

1. Create a custom iterator that iterates over the first `n` even numbers starting from `0`. The iterator should have the following methods:

   - `__init__(self, n)`: Initializes the iterator with the number of even numbers to generate.
   - `__iter__(self)`: Returns the iterator object itself.
   - `__next__(self)`: Returns the next even number in the sequence or raises a `StopIteration` exception when there are no more even numbers to iterate over.

Ans:

```python
class EvenNumbers:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n
        self.count = 0
        self.current = -2

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.count == self.n:
            raise StopIteration
        self.count += 1
        self.current += 2
        return self.current
```

2. Create an object from the custom iterator with `n = 10` and iterate over the even numbers.

Ans:

```python
even_numbers = EvenNumbers(10)
for number in even_numbers:
    print(number)
```
