# 8.4 File Handling

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Read and write text files in Python.
- Use the `open()` function to work with files.
- Handle file errors and exceptions.
- Read and write binary files in Python.
- Use the `with` statement to automatically close files.

## Introduction

In Python, you can read and write files using the built-in `open()` function. The `open()` function is used to open files in different modes, such as read mode (`'r'`), write mode (`'w'`), append mode (`'a'`), and binary mode (`'b'`). You can read text files, write text files, read binary files, and write binary files using the `open()` function.

## Reading Text Files

To read a text file in Python, you can use the `open()` function with the read mode (`'r'`). The `open()` function returns a file object that you can use to read the contents of the file.

For example, you can read the contents of a text file named `example.txt` as follows:

```python
file = open("assets/example.txt", "r")
content = file.read()
print(content)
file.close()
```

In this example, the `open()` function opens the `example.txt` file in read mode (`'r'`). The `file.read()` method reads the contents of the file, and the `file.close()` method closes the file.

## Writing Text Files

To write to a text file in Python, you can use the `open()` function with the write mode (`'w'`). The `open()` function returns a file object that you can use to write data to the file.

For example, you can write text to a file named `output.txt` as follows:

```python
file = open("assets/output.txt", "w")
file.write("Hello, world!")
file.close()
```

In this example, the `open()` function opens the `output.txt` file in write mode (`'w'`). The `file.write()` method writes the text `"Hello, world!"` to the file, and the `file.close()` method closes the file.

## Handling File Errors

When working with files in Python, you should handle errors and exceptions that may occur. For example, if the file you are trying to open does not exist, you may encounter a `FileNotFoundError`.

To handle file errors, you can use `try` and `except` blocks to catch exceptions and display error messages. For example:

```python
try:
    file = open("assets/exercise.txt", "r")
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
    file.close()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found!")
```

In this example, the `try` block attempts to open the `exercise.txt` file and read its contents. If the file does not exist and a `FileNotFoundError` is raised, the `except` block catches the exception and displays an error message.

## Reading Binary Files

Binary files contain data in a binary format, such as images, audio files, and executables.

To read a binary file in Python, you can use the `open()` function with the binary mode (`'rb'`). The binary mode allows you to read the contents of the file as binary data.

For example, you can read the contents of a binary file named `data.bin` as follows:

```python
file = open("assets/data.bin", "rb")
content = file.read()
print(content)
file.close()
```

In this example, the `open()` function opens the `data.bin` file in binary mode (`'rb'`). The `file.read()` method reads the binary data from the file, and the `file.close()` method closes the file.

## Writing Binary Files

To write to a binary file in Python, you can use the `open()` function with the binary write mode (`'wb'`). The binary write mode allows you to write binary data to the file.

For example, you can write binary data to a file named `output.bin` as follows:

```python
data = b"\x48\x65\x6c\x6c\x6f\x2c\x20\x77\x6f\x72\x6c\x64\x21"
file = open("assets/output.bin", "wb")
file.write(data)
file.close()
```

In this example, the `data` variable contains binary data represented as a byte string. The `open()` function opens the `output.bin` file in binary write mode (`'wb'`). The `file.write()` method writes the binary data to the file, and the `file.close()` method closes the file.

## Using the `with` Statement

To ensure that files are properly closed after reading or writing, you can use the `with` statement in Python. The `with` statement automatically closes the file when the block of code is exited.

For example, you can read the contents of a text file using the `with` statement as follows:

```python
with open("assets/example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

In this example, the `with` statement opens the `example.txt` file in read mode (`'r'`). The `file.read()` method reads the contents of the file, and the file is automatically closed when the block of code is exited.

## Exercise

1. Write a Python program that reads the contents of a text file named `assets/input.txt` and displays the contents on the screen.
2. Modify the program to write the contents of the `assets/input.txt` file to a new file named `assets/output.txt`.
