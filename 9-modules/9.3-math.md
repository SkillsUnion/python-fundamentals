## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Perform mathematical operations in Python using the `math` module.
- Work with floating-point numbers and perform rounding operations.
- Generate random numbers using the `random` module.

## Introduction

In Python, you can perform mathematical operations using the built-in `math` module. The `math` module provides functions and constants for mathematical operations, such as trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions, and mathematical constants. You can use the `math` module to perform complex mathematical calculations and operations in Python programs.

## Performing Mathematical Operations

To perform mathematical operations in Python, you need to import the `math` module. You can import the `math` module using the `import` statement as follows:

```python
import math
```

Once you have imported the `math` module, you can use its functions and constants in your code. For example, you can calculate the square root of a number using the `sqrt()` function:

```python
import math

result = math.sqrt(25)
print(result)  # 5.0
```

Here are the common mathematical functions provided by the `math` module:

| Function          | Description                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `math.sqrt(x)`    | Returns the square root of `x`.             |
| `math.pow(x, y)`  | Returns `x` raised to the power of `y`.     |
| `math.exp(x)`     | Returns the exponential value of `x`.       |
| `math.log(x)`     | Returns the natural logarithm of `x`.       |
| `math.sin(x)`     | Returns the sine of `x` (in radians).       |
| `math.cos(x)`     | Returns the cosine of `x` (in radians).     |
| `math.tan(x)`     | Returns the tangent of `x` (in radians).    |
| `math.degrees(x)` | Converts angle `x` from radians to degrees. |
| `math.radians(x)` | Converts angle `x` from degrees to radians. |
| `math.pi`         | Mathematical constant Ï€ (pi).               |
| `math.e`          | Mathematical constant e (Euler's number).   |
| `math.inf`        | Positive infinity.                          |
| `math.nan`        | Not a number (NaN).                         |

## Working with Floating-Point Numbers

In Python, floating-point numbers are used to represent real numbers with a decimal point. Floating-point numbers can be used to perform calculations involving fractions, decimals, and scientific notation. However, floating-point numbers may not always be represented accurately due to the limitations of the floating-point format.

For example, when performing calculations with floating-point numbers, you may encounter rounding errors due to the limited precision of floating-point representations. To address this issue, you can use the `round()` function to round floating-point numbers to a specified number of decimal places.

```python
value = 1.23456789
rounded_value = round(value, 2)

print(rounded_value)  # 1.23
```

### Fractional and Decimal Numbers

In addition to floating-point numbers, Python provides the `fractions` and `decimal` modules for working with fractional and decimal numbers. The `fractions` module allows you to work with rational numbers represented as fractions, while the `decimal` module provides support for fixed-point decimal arithmetic.

You can import the `fractions` and `decimal` modules as follows:

```python
import fractions
import decimal
```

You can then use the functions and classes provided by the `fractions` and `decimal` modules to perform calculations with fractional and decimal numbers.

## Generating Random Numbers

In Python, you can generate random numbers using the `random` module. The `random` module provides functions for generating random integers, floating-point numbers, and sequences. You can use the `random` module to generate random numbers for simulations, games, and statistical analysis.

To use the `random` module, you need to import it into your code as follows:

```python
import random
```

Once you have imported the `random` module, you can use its functions to generate random numbers. For example, you can generate a random integer between 1 and 10 using the `randint()` function:

```python
import random

random_number = random.randint(1, 10)
print(random_number)
```

Here are some common functions provided by the `random` module:

| Function                | Description                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `random.random()`       | Returns a random floating-point number in [0, 1).                |
| `random.randint(a, b)`  | Returns a random integer between `a` and `b` (inclusive).        |
| `random.choice(seq)`    | Returns a random element from the sequence `seq`.                |
| `random.shuffle(seq)`   | Shuffles the elements of the sequence `seq` in place.            |
| `random.sample(seq, k)` | Returns a random sample of `k` elements from the sequence `seq`. |

## Exercise

1. Calculate the area of a circle with a radius of 5 using the `math.pi` constant and the `math.pow()` function. Display the result with two decimal places.
2. Generate a random integer between 1 and 100 using the `random.randint()` function and display the result.
3. Selects a random element from the list `["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]` using the `random.choice()` function and display the result.
