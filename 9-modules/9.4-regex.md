# 9.4 Regular Expressions (Regex)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Understand the rules and syntax of regular expressions.
- Work with regular expression functions and methods.
- Perform text manipulation and extraction using regular expressions.

## Introduction

In Python, regular expressions (regex) are used to match patterns in text data. Regular expressions provide a powerful and flexible way to search, match, and manipulate text using patterns. You can use regular expressions to perform tasks such as searching for specific words, extracting data from text, and validating input.

Python provides the `re` module for working with regular expressions. The `re` module includes functions and methods for creating and using regular expressions in Python programs. You can use regular expressions to search for patterns in strings, replace text, split strings, and perform other text manipulation tasks.

## Understanding Regular Expressions

A regular expression is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. Regular expressions are used to match patterns in text data, such as specific words, characters, or sequences of characters. Regular expressions can be simple or complex, depending on the pattern you want to match.

Here are some common characters and symbols used in regular expressions:

| Character | Description                                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `.`       | Matches any character except a newline.         |
| `^`       | Matches the start of a string.                  |
| `$`       | Matches the end of a string.                    |
| `*`       | Matches zero or more occurrences.               |
| `+`       | Matches one or more occurrences.                |
| `?`       | Matches zero or one occurrence.                 |
| `[]`      | Matches any character inside the brackets.      |
| `()`      | Groups characters together.                     |
| `\`       | Escapes special characters.                     |
| `{}`      | Matches a specific number of occurrences.       |
| `\d`      | Matches any digit (0-9).                        |
| `\w`      | Matches any word character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, \_). |
| `\s`      | Matches any whitespace character.               |
| `\b`      | Matches a word boundary.                        |
| `[^]`     | Matches any character not inside the brackets.  |

## Using Regular Expressions

To use regular expressions in Python, you need to import the `re` module. The `re` module provides functions and methods for working with regular expressions. You can create regular expressions using the `re.compile()` function and use them to search, match, and manipulate text data.

```python
import re

# Search for digits in the text
text = 'Welcome to the class. Your student ID is 12345. Enjoy your learning!'

pattern = re.compile(r'\d+')

matches = pattern.findall(text)

print(matches)  # ['12345']
```

We import the `re` module and create a regular expression pattern using the `re.compile()` function. The `r` prefix before the pattern string indicates a raw string, which is used to avoid escaping special characters. We then use the `pattern.findall()` method to find all occurrences of digits in the text.

## Regular Expression Functions and Methods

The `re` module provides several functions and methods for working with regular expressions. Here are some common functions and methods used with regular expressions:

| Function/Method                      | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `re.compile(pattern)`                | Compiles a regular expression pattern.                                      |
| `re.search(pattern, text)`           | Searches for the pattern in the text.                                       |
| `re.match(pattern, text)`            | Matches the pattern at the beginning of the text.                           |
| `re.findall(pattern, text)`          | Finds all occurrences of the pattern in the text.                           |
| `re.sub(pattern, replacement, text)` | Replaces occurrences of the pattern with the replacement in the text.       |
| `re.split(pattern, text)`            | Splits the text into a list of substrings using the pattern as a delimiter. |

You can use these functions and methods to perform various text manipulation tasks using regular expressions.

To use the `re.sub()` method to replace occurrences of a pattern in a string:

```python
text = 'Hello, World! This is Python.'

# Replace 'Python' with 'Java'
new_text = re.sub(r'Python', 'Java', text)

print(new_text)  # Hello, World! This is Java.
```

To use the `re.search()` method to search for a pattern in a string:

```python
text = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'

# Search for the word 'fox'
match = re.search(text)

if match:
    print('Pattern found:', match.group())
else:
    print('Pattern not found.')
```

In this example, we use the `re.search()` method to search for the word `'fox'` in the text. If the pattern is found, we print the matched text using the `match.group()` method.

## Exercise

1. Write a Python program that loops through a list of email addresses and extracts the valid email addresses using regular expressions. Example list of email addresses:

   ```python
   emails = [
       "user@example.com",
       "invalid.email@",
       "another.user@domain.co.uk",
       "not_an_email",
       "test.email+alias@example.com",
       "@missingusername.com"
   ]
   ```

2. Modify the program to extract the domain names (e.g., `example.com`, `domain.co.uk`) from the valid email addresses.
