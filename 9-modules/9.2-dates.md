# 9.2 Dates

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Work with dates and times in Python using the `datetime` module.
- Create and manipulate date objects.
- Format dates and times for display.
- Perform date arithmetic and comparisons.
- Handle time zones and daylight saving time.

## Introduction

In Python, you can work with dates and times using the built-in `datetime` module. The `datetime` module provides classes for working with dates, times, and time intervals in Python. You can create date objects, manipulate dates, format dates for display, perform date arithmetic, and handle time zones using the `datetime` module.

## Working with Dates

To work with dates in Python, you need to import the `datetime` module. The `datetime` module provides the `date` class, which represents a date in the Gregorian calendar. You can create date objects using the `date` class constructor

```python
from datetime import date

# Create a date object for the current date
today = date.today()

print(today)  # 2022-01-01
```

### Formatting Dates

You can format dates for display using the `strftime()` method of the `date` class. The `strftime()` method allows you to specify a format string to customize the output format of the date.

```python
# Create a date object for the current date
today = date.today()

# Format the date as "YYYY-MM-DD"
formatted_date = today.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

print(formatted_date)
```

We create a date object for the current date and format the date as "YYYY-MM-DD" using the `strftime()` method with the format string `"%Y-%m-%d"`.

## Working with Dates and Times

In addition to working with dates, you can also work with dates and times using the `datetime` class in the `datetime` module. The `datetime` class represents a date and time in the Gregorian calendar. You can create datetime objects using the `datetime` class constructor.

```python
from datetime import datetime

# Create a datetime object for the current date and time
now = datetime.now()

print(now)
```

### Formatting Dates and Times

You can format dates and times for display using the `strftime()` method of the `datetime` class. The `strftime()` method allows you to specify a format string to customize the output format of the date and time.

```python
# Create a datetime object for the current date and time
now = datetime.now()

# Format the datetime as "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
formatted_datetime = now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

print(formatted_datetime)
```

### Parsing Dates and Times

You can parse date and time strings into datetime objects using the `strptime()` method of the `datetime` class. The `strptime()` method allows you to convert a string representation of a date and time into a datetime object.

```python
# Parse a date and time string into a datetime object
datetime_str = "2022-01-01 12:00:00"

parsed_datetime = datetime.strptime(datetime_str, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

print(parsed_datetime) # 2022-01-01 12:00:00
```

For more information on date and time formatting codes, refer to the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes).

## Date and Time Arithmetic and Comparisons

You can perform arithmetic operations on dates and times in Python using the `timedelta` class in the `datetime` module. The `timedelta` class represents a duration of time and allows you to add or subtract time intervals from date and time objects.

```python
from datetime import date, datetime, timedelta

# Create a date object for the current date
today = date.today()

# Create a timedelta object for 7 days
one_week = timedelta(days=7)

# Calculate the date 7 days from today
next_week = today + one_week

print(next_week)

# Create datetime objects for two datetimes
datetime1 = datetime(2022, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0)
datetime2 = datetime(2022, 1, 1, 18, 0, 0)

# Calculate the time difference between the two datetimes
time_difference = datetime2 - datetime1

print(time_difference)  # 6:00:00
```

You can also compare dates and times in Python using comparison operators such as `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, and `!=`. Date and time objects are compared based on their chronological order.

```python
from datetime import date

# Create date objects for two dates
date1 = date(2022, 1, 1)
date2 = date(2022, 1, 15)

# Compare the two dates
if date1 < date2:
    print("date1 is before date2")
else:
    print("date1 is after date2")
```

## Time Zones and Daylight Saving Time

When working with dates and times in Python, you may need to handle time zones and daylight saving time. The `datetime` module provides the `timezone` class to represent time zones and the `tzinfo` class to define time zone information.

You can create datetime objects with time zone information using the `astimezone()` method and the `timezone` class. You can also convert datetime objects between different time zones using the `astimezone()` method.

```python
from datetime import datetime

# Create a datetime object for the current date and time
now = datetime.now()

# Set the time zone to UTC
utc_timezone = timezone.utc

# Convert the datetime to UTC time zone
utc_time = now.astimezone(utc_timezone)

print(utc_time)
```

## Exercise

1. Write a Python program that calculates the number of days between two dates: January 1, 2022, and December 31, 2022.

Ans:

```python
from datetime import date

# Create date objects for two dates
date1 = date(2022, 1, 1)
date2 = date(2022, 12, 31)

# Calculate the number of days between the two dates
days_difference = (date2 - date1).days

print(days_difference)
```

2. Write a Python program that calculates the number of hours between two datetimes: January 1, 2022, 12:00 PM, and January 2, 2022, 6:00 PM.

Ans:

```python
from datetime import datetime

# Create datetime objects for two datetimes
datetime1 = datetime(2022, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0)
datetime2 = datetime(2022, 1, 2, 18, 0, 0)

# Calculate the number of hours between the two datetimes
hours_difference = (datetime2 - datetime1).seconds // 3600

print(hours_difference)
```

3. Write a Python program that converts a datetime from one time zone to another (e.g., from UTC to a specific time zone).

Ans:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone

# Create a datetime object for the current date and time
now = datetime.now()

# Set the time zone to UTC
utc_timezone = timezone.utc

# Convert the datetime to UTC time zone
utc_time = now.astimezone(utc_timezone)

print(utc_time)

# Set the time zone to a specific time zone
specific_timezone = timezone(timedelta(hours=5))

# Convert the datetime to the specific time zone
specific_time = utc_time.astimezone(specific_timezone)

print(specific_time)
```

4. Write a Python program that adds 5 days and 3 hours to the current date and time.

Ans:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Create a datetime object for the current date and time
now = datetime.now()

# Create a timedelta object for 5 days and 3 hours
time_delta = timedelta(days=5, hours=3)

# Calculate the date and time 5 days and 3 hours from now
future_time = now + time_delta

print(future_time)
```
