# 3.1 String

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Define strings in Python
- Access characters in a string
- Concatenate strings
- Use string methods
- Use string formatting

## Introduction

Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in single or double quotes. They are one of the most common data types in Python and are used to represent text data.

```python
x = "Hello, World!"
y = 'Python'
```

### Quotes inside Strings

If you need to include quotes inside a string, you can use the other type of quotes to enclose the string. For example:

```python
x = "He said, 'Hello, World!'"
y = 'She said, "Python"'
```

### Multiline Strings

If you need to create a string that spans multiple lines, you can use triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`) to enclose the string. For example:

```python
x = '''This is a
multiline
string.'''
```

## Accessing Characters

### Indexing

You can access individual characters in a string using indexing. In Python, strings are zero-indexed, which means that the first character is at index `0`, the second character is at index `1`, and so on.

```python
x = "Hello, World!"

print(x[0])  # H
print(x[7])  # W
```

You can also use negative indexing to access characters from the end of the string. In negative indexing, the last character is at index `-1`, the second-to-last character is at index `-2`, and so on.

```python
print(x[-1])  # !
print(x[-6])  # W
```

### Slicing

You can also return a range of characters from a string using slicing. Slicing is done by specifying the start and end indices separated by a colon (`:`). For example:

```python
print(x[7:12])  # World
```

If you omit the start index, Python will start from the beginning of the string. If you omit the end index, Python will go to the end of the string. For example:

```python
print(x[:5])  # Hello
print(x[7:])  # World
```

There's an optional third parameter in slicing called the step. The step specifies the increment between the characters in the slice. For example:

```python
print(x[2:12:2]) # lo Wrd
print(x[::2])  # Hlo ol!
```

You can reverse a string by using a negative step.

```python
print(x[::-1])  # !dlroW ,olleH
```

## String Concatenation

You can concatenate (combine) strings using the `+` operator. For example:

```python
x = "Hello"
y = "World"

z = x + ", " + y + "!"

print(z)  # Hello, World!
```

You can also use the `*` operator to repeat a string a certain number of times. For example:

```python
x = "Hello"

y = x * 3

print(y)  # HelloHelloHello
```

## String Methods

Python provides many built-in methods for working with strings. Here are some common string methods:

- `upper()`: Converts the string to uppercase.
- `lower()`: Converts the string to lowercase.
- `strip()`: Removes whitespace from the beginning and end of the string.
- `replace()`: Replaces a substring with another substring.
- `split()`: Splits the string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter.
- `join()`: Joins a list of strings into a single string.

Here are some examples of using string methods:

```python
x = "Hello, World!"

print(x.upper())  # HELLO, WORLD!
print(x.lower())  # hello, world!
print(x.strip())  # Hello, World!
print(x.replace("Hello", "Hi"))  # Hi, World!
print(x.split(","))  # ['Hello', ' World!']
```

Note that string methods do not modify the original string; they return a new string with the modified content. If you want to modify the original string, you need to assign the result back to the original variable.

```python
x = "Hello, World!"

x = x.upper()

print(x)  # HELLO, WORLD!
```

There is a built-in function called `len()` that returns the length of a string.

> Note the difference between a function and a method. A function is a standalone piece of code that can be called with arguments. A method is a function that belongs to an object and is called using the dot notation.

```python
x = "Hello, World!"

print(len(x))  # 13
```

## String Formatting

String formatting allows you to create dynamic strings by inserting variables into a string. There are several ways to format strings in Python, but the most common method is using the `format()` method.

You can use curly braces `{}` as placeholders in a string and pass variables to the `format()` method to replace the placeholders with the variable values. For example:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30

x = "My name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(name, age)

print(x)  # My name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
```

You can also use curly braces with indices to specify the order of the variables passed to the `format()` method. For example:

```python
x = "My name is {1} and I am {0} years old.".format(age, name)

print(x)  # My name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
```

### f-Strings

f-strings are a more recent and convenient way to format strings in Python. You can prefix a string with `f` or `F` and use curly braces `{}` to insert variables directly into the string. For example:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30

x = f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."

print(x)  # My name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
```

You can also perform operations inside the curly braces.

```python
num1 = 10
num2 = 20

x = f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {num1 + num2}"

print(x)  # The sum of 10 and 20 is 30
```

### Format Specifiers

You can also use format specifiers to format the output of variables in a string.

For example, you can specify the width of the field and the alignment.

```python
name = "Alice"

x = f"Hello, {name:>10}"

print(x)  # Hello,      Alice
```

You can also specify the number of decimal places for a floating-point number.

```python
pi = 3.14159

x = f"The value of pi is {pi:.2f}"

print(x)  # The value of pi is 3.14
```

For integers, you can specify the number of digits and padding.

```python
num = 42

x = f"The answer is {num:05d}"

print(x)  # The answer is 00042
```

## Exercise

1. What is the output of the following code?

```python
x = "Hello, World!"
print(x[7:12])
```

Ans: `World`

2. What is the output of the following code?

```python
x = "Hello, World!"

y = x.replace("Hello", "Hi")

print(x)
print(y)
```

Ans: `Hello, World!`, `Hi, World!`

3. What is the output of the following code?

```python
x = "Hello, World!"

y = x.split(",")

print(y)
```

Ans: `['Hello', ' World!']`
