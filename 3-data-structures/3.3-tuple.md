# 3.3 Tuple

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Define tuples in Python
- Access elements in a tuple
- Modify elements in a tuple
- Use tuple methods
- Unpack tuples

## Introduction

Tuples are another data structure in Python that are similar to lists. They are used to store collections of items, such as numbers, strings, or other objects. However, tuples are immutable, which means that you cannot change the elements they contain after the tuple is created.

When defining a tuple in Python, you enclose the elements in parentheses `()` and separate them with commas `,`. For example:

```python
# Define a tuple of numbers
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Define a tuple of strings
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
```

You can also create an empty tuple by using empty parentheses or the `tuple()` constructor. Tuples with a single element must have a trailing comma to distinguish them from parentheses:

```python
# Create an empty tuple
empty_tuple = ()
empty_tuple = tuple()

# Tuple with a single element
single_tuple = (1,)
```

The `tuple()` constructor can also convert a tuple:

```python
# Create a tuple from a string
chars = tuple("hello")

print(chars)  # ('h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o')
```

Just like lists, operators like `+` and `*` work on tuples as well.

```python
numbers1 = (1, 2, 3)
numbers2 = (4, 5, 6)

# Concatenate two tuples
numbers = numbers1 + numbers2

print(numbers)  # (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

# Repeat a tuple
numbers = numbers1 * 3

print(numbers)  # (1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)
```

## Accessing Elements

Indexing and slicing work the same way for tuples as they do for lists.

```python
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

print(numbers[0])  # 1
print(numbers[2])  # 3
print(numbers[-1])  # 5
print(numbers[:3])  # (1, 2, 3)
print(numbers[2:])  # (3, 4, 5)
```

## Modifying Elements

Since tuples are immutable, you cannot change the elements they contain. If you try to modify a tuple, you will get an error:

```python
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

numbers[0] = 10  # TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```

## Tuple Methods

Tuples have fewer methods than lists because they are immutable. However, there are a few methods that you can use with tuples:

- `count()`: Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in the tuple.
- `index()`: Returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value.

```python
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3)

print(numbers.count(3))  # 2
print(numbers.index(4))  # 3
```

## Unpacking Tuples

You can unpack a tuple by assigning its elements to multiple variables. This is useful when you want to assign the elements of a tuple to individual variables:

```python
numbers = (1, 2, 3)

x, y, z = numbers

print(x)  # 1
print(y)  # 2
print(z)  # 3
```

You can also use the `*` operator to unpack the remaining elements of a tuple into a list:

```python
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

x, *y, z = numbers

print(x)  # 1
print(y)  # [2, 3, 4]
print(z)  # 5
```

## Exercise

1. What is the result of the following expressions?
   - `(1, 2, 3) + (4, 5, 6)`
   - `(1, 2, 3) * 3`
   - `("a", "b", "c")[1]`
   - `("a", "b", "c")[0:2]`
   - `("a", "b", "c")[1:]`
     Ans: `(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)`, `(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)`, `'b'`, `('a', 'b')`, `('b', 'c')`
2. What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?
   Ans: Lists are mutable, while tuples are immutable. Lists are defined using square brackets `[]`, while tuples are defined using parentheses `()`. Lists have more methods than tuples because they can be modified after creation.
3. What is the output of the following code?

   ```python
   numbers = (2, 3, 4, 5)

   x, *y, z = numbers

   print(y)
   ```

   Ans: `[3, 4]`
