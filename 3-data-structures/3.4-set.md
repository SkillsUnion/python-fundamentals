# 3.4 Set

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Define sets in Python
- Modify elements in a set
- Perform set operations

## Introduction

A set is a collection of unique elements in Python. Sets are unordered, which means that the elements do not have a specific order. Sets are mutable, which means that you can add or remove elements from a set after it is created.

When defining a set in Python, you enclose the elements in curly braces `{}` and separate them with commas `,`. For example:

```python
# Define a set of numbers
numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Define a set of strings
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
```

You can also create an empty set by using empty curly braces or the `set()` constructor. However, you cannot create an empty set using empty curly braces because they are used to define an empty dictionary:

```python
# Create an empty set
empty_set = set()
```

The `set()` constructor can also convert a list or tuple to a set:

```python
# Create a set from a list
numbers = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

print(numbers)  # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# If the list contains duplicate elements, they will be removed in the set
numbers = set([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5])

print(numbers)  # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

## Accessing Elements

Sets are unordered, which means that you cannot access elements in a set using indexing.

## Modifying Elements

Sets are mutable, which means that you can add or remove elements from a set after it is created.

### Adding Elements

You can add elements to a set using the `add()` method:

```python
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

fruits.add("orange")

print(fruits)  # {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange'}

# If the element already exists in the set, it will not be added again
fruits.add("apple")

print(fruits)  # {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange'}
```

You can also add multiple elements to a set using the `update()` method:

```python
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

fruits.update(["apple", "pear", "grape"])

print(fruits)  # {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'grape', 'pear'}
```

### Removing Elements

You can remove elements from a set using the `remove()` method. If the element does not exist in the set, you will get an error:

```python
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

fruits.remove("banana")

print(fruits)  # {'apple', 'cherry'}
```

## Set Operations

Sets support various operations, such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.

### Union

The union of two sets contains all the elements from both sets:

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}

union = set1 | set2

print(union)  # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

You can also use the `union()` method to perform the union operation:

```python
union = set1.union(set2)

print(union)  # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

### Intersection

The intersection of two sets contains the elements that are common to both sets:

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}

intersection = set1 & set2

print(intersection)  # {3}
```

You can also use the `intersection()` method to perform the intersection operation:

```python
intersection = set1.intersection(set2)

print(intersection)  # {3}
```

### Difference

The difference between two sets contains the elements that are in the first set but not in the second set:

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}

difference = set1 - set2

print(difference)  # {1, 2}
```

You can also use the `difference()` method to perform the difference operation:

```python
difference = set1.difference(set2)

print(difference)  # {1, 2}
```

### Symmetric Difference

The symmetric difference between two sets contains the elements that are in either set but not in both sets:

```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}

symmetric_difference = set1 ^ set2

print(symmetric_difference)  # {1, 2, 4, 5}
```

You can also use the `symmetric_difference()` method to perform the symmetric difference operation:

```python
symmetric_difference = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)

print(symmetric_difference)  # {1, 2, 4, 5}
```

## Exercise

1. What is the result of the following expressions?
   - `{1, 2, 3} | {3, 4, 5}`
   - `{1, 2, 3} & {3, 4, 5}`
   - `{1, 2, 3} - {3, 4, 5}`
   - `{1, 2, 3} ^ {3, 4, 5}`
2. How can you remove duplicates from a list in Python?
