- Modify elements in a dictionary
- Use dictionary methods
- Copy a dictionary

## Introduction

Dictionaries are another data structure in Python that are used to store collections of items. Unlike lists and tuples, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys. Keys can be any _immutable_ type, such as strings, numbers, or tuples. While the values in a dictionary can be of any type, the keys must be unique within a dictionary.

When defining a dictionary in Python, you enclose the key-value pairs in curly braces `{}` and separate them with commas `,`. Each key-value pair is separated by a colon `:`. For example:

```python
# Define a dictionary of student names and their ages
students = {"Alice": 20, "Bob": 21, "Charlie": 22}

# Define an empty dictionary
empty_dict = {}
```

You can also create a dictionary using the `dict()` constructor:

```python
# Create a dictionary using the dict() constructor
students = dict(Alice=20, Bob=21, Charlie=22)

print(students)  # {'Alice': 20, 'Bob': 21, 'Charlie': 22}
```

## Accessing Elements

Dictionaries are indexed by keys, which means that you can access elements in a dictionary using the keys. If the key exists in the dictionary, you can access the corresponding value using the key. For example:

```python
print(students["Alice"])  # 20
print(students["Bob"])    # 21
```

If the key does not exist in the dictionary, you will get a `KeyError`:

```python
print(students["Eve"])  # KeyError: 'Eve'
```

To avoid this error, you can use the `get()` method, which returns `None` if the key does not exist in the dictionary:

```python
print(students.get("Eve"))  # None
```

You can also specify a default value to return if the key does not exist in the dictionary:

```python
print(students.get("Eve", 0))  # 0
```

## Modifying Elements

Dictionaries are mutable, which means that you can add, update, or remove elements from a dictionary after it is created.

### Adding Elements

You can add elements to a dictionary by assigning a value to a new key:

```python
students["Eve"] = 23

print(students)  # {'Alice': 20, 'Bob': 21, 'Charlie': 22, 'Eve': 23}
```

### Updating Elements

You can update elements in a dictionary by assigning a new value to an existing key:

```python
students["Alice"] = 21

print(students)  # {'Alice': 21, 'Bob': 21, 'Charlie': 22, 'Eve': 23}
```

### Removing Elements

You can remove elements from a dictionary using the `del` keyword:

```python
del students["Eve"]

print(students)  # {'Alice': 21, 'Bob': 21, 'Charlie': 22}
```

You can also use the `pop()` method to remove an element from a dictionary and return its value:

```python
age = students.pop("Bob")

print(age)      # 21
print(students)  # {'Alice': 21, 'Charlie': 22}
```

## Dictionary Methods

Dictionaries have several methods that you can use to work with them:

- `keys()`: Returns a view of the keys in the dictionary.
- `values()`: Returns a view of the values in the dictionary.
- `items()`: Returns a view of the key-value pairs in the dictionary.
- `get()`: Returns the value for a specified key. If the key does not exist, it returns `None`.
- `pop()`: Removes the element with the specified key and returns its value.
- `popitem()`: Removes the last inserted key-value pair from the dictionary and returns it.
- `update()`: Updates the dictionary with the specified key-value pairs.

```python
students = {"Alice": 20, "Bob": 21, "Charlie": 22}

# Get the keys in the dictionary
print(students.keys())  # dict_keys(['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'])

# Get the values in the dictionary
print(students.values())  # dict_values([20, 21, 22])

# Get the key-value pairs in the dictionary
print(students.items())  # dict_items([('Alice', 20), ('Bob', 21), ('Charlie', 22])

# Remove the last inserted key-value pair
key, value = students.popitem()

print(key)    # Charlie
print(value)  # 22

# Update the dictionary with new key-value pairs
students.update({"David": 23, "Eve": 24})

print(students)  # {'Alice': 20, 'David': 23, 'Eve': 24}
```

## Copying a Dictionary

When you assign a dictionary to a new variable, you are creating a reference to the original dictionary, not a copy of it. This means that if you modify the new dictionary, the original dictionary will also be modified. To create a copy of a dictionary, you can use the `copy()` method:

```python
students = {"Alice": 20, "Bob": 21, "Charlie": 22}

# Create a reference to the original dictionary
students_copy = students

# Modify the copy
students_copy["Alice"] = 25

print(students)        # {'Alice': 25, 'Bob': 21, 'Charlie': 22}

# Create a copy of the original dictionary
students_copy = students.copy()

# Modify the copy
students_copy["Bob"] = 26

print(students)        # {'Alice': 25, 'Bob': 21, 'Charlie': 22}
print(students_copy)  # {'Alice': 25, 'Bob': 26, 'Charlie': 22}
```

## Exercise Questions

```python
students = {"Alice": 20, "Bob": 21, "Charlie": 22}

print(students.get("David", 0))
```

2. How do you add a new key-value pair to a dictionary named `items` with the key `name` and the value `Alice`?

students.update({"Bob": 23, "Eve": 24})

print(students)
```
